      Hi, I'm Daniel. ![Waving hand emoji](/media/1F44B.svg)

      I'm a [web developer/designer](https://medium.com/chingu/website-builder-vs-web-developer-vs-designer-vs-consultant-6a8de6ffd5f7) based in Pittsburgh, working primarily with [Node.js](https://hackernoon.com/7-upcoming-nodejs-trends-to-watch-in-2020-6zh32tr) and modern [build tools](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/making-sense-of-front-end-build-tools-3a1b3a87043b/) for the [JAMstack](https://medium.com/memory-leak/the-jamstack-its-pretty-sweet-e0834e4e6bb7).

      ## What I'm Working On

      Last year, I launched my web design and consulting business, [Metamodern Design Limited](https://metamodern.design). I've been building websites for local clients ([1](https://atlanticgrating.com), [2](https://cook-denomebail.com)) and developing [tools and systems](https://github.com/metamodern-design/) to facilitate my work. 

      While gaining experience as an independent developer, I'm also seeking a longer-term opportunity that will allow me to grow as part of a technical team and find my niche in a specific developer role.

      ## How I Got Here

      As someone with an innate curiosity, I'm always looking for the next thing to learn. In my mid-30s, around the time I became a new parent, I was searching for a new career path, and I rediscovered a passion for building things with code. After a couple years focused on skill-building (and parenting), I am ready to take my work to the next professional level.

      Thanks to a string of computer science classes in high school and college, I have a strong command of programming fundamentals. I also gained experience working with data in various forms through my research methods coursework and some [online data science courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). I've put all of that together with my interest in visual design to become a competent front-end developer, and I'm now working to expand my knowledge so that I can claim the "full-stack" label.

      For what it's worth, I hold a bachelor's degree in environmental science and a master's in sociology.
