      ### Family
      
      With our son now approaching his third birthday, every waking moment is [trucks](https://www.youtube.com/user/twentytrucks) and [construction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI-GA-tkajI)!
      
      
      ### Reading
      
      Almost done with Haruki Murakami's [Killing Commendatore](http://www.harukimurakami.com/book/killing-commendatore-2). I've read most of his novels and this one doesn't disappoint – it seems closer to his earlier novels than his more recent ones in character and plot development.
      
      
      ### Music
      
      Digging [Bill Evans](https://open.spotify.com/album/2zSAVheEFBPMuUozd6C9gt), once again. Recently discovered his [collaboration with Tony Bennett](https://open.spotify.com/album/7oviEOBGFIC09QpiWRnyFF) – beautiful arrangements of some less-often-covered standards.
      
      Meditating on Maurice Ravel's unfathomably intricate [piano compositions](https://open.spotify.com/album/66ZlwcSXFuzedj7X18rCLI).
      
      Appreciating the masterful songwriting in Bruce Springsteen's [Western Stars](https://open.spotify.com/album/6BhqPpIgY83rqoZ2L78Lte).
      
      
      ### Podcasts
      
      Keeping up on debates in progressive politics with [The Ezra Klein Show](https://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast). 
      
      
      ### Streaming TV
      
      Blown away by the thoughtful adaptation and high production quality Amazon's limited series [Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams](https://www.amazon.com/Philip-K-Dicks-Electric-Dreams/dp/B075NTXMN9).
