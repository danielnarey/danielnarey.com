### Developer Setup

Last year, I replaced my old MacBook with an iPad Pro, and I am now able to use it for 99% of what I do as a developer. Keeping my local changes synced with cloud repositories has improved my workflow, and the iPad's Liquid Retina / True Tone display is saving my eyesight. Here's my setup:

- __Device:__ [iPad Pro (11-inch)](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/specs/) with [Smart Keyboard Folio](https://www.apple.com/smart-keyboard/)
- __Code editor:__ [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/)
- __Git client:__ [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/)
- __Terminal emulator & Mosh/SSH client:__ [Blink](http://www.blink.sh/)
- __Remote development server__: [Digital Ocean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/) running [Ubuntu 18](https://ubuntu.com/server) with [Node.js 12](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed ($5 per month for 1GB memory / 25 GB SSD)
- __Git host providers__: [GitHub](https://github.com/) for public projects, [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) for client work
