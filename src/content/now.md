### Family

Our son is a couple months shy of 3 – every waking moment is trucks and construction!


### Reading

Almost done with Haruki Murakami's Killing Commendatore. I've read most of his novels and this one doesn't disappoint – it seems closer to his earlier novels than his more recent ones in character and plot development.


### Music

Digging Bill Evans. Recently discovered his collaboration with Tony Bennett – beautiful arrangements of some less-often-covered standards.

Obsessed with Maurice Ravel's solo piano compositions – unfathomably intricate.

In a more populist vein, Bruce Springsteen's Western Stars has some great songwriting.


### Podcasts

The Ezra Klein Show is required listening for understanding politics and political theory in the US today.
