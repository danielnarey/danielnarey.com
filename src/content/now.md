### Family

Our son is a couple months shy of 3 – every waking moment is trucks and construction!


### Work

After taking on some freelance clients this past year, I'm currently seeking a longer-term opportunity that will allow me to grow as a developer, be part of a dynamic team, and find my niche in a specific developer role.


### Politics

I'm closely following the Democratic Primary race. Elizabeth Warren is my progressive favorite, though I could easily get behind Bernie Sanders if he has a strong showing in the early states. 


### Reading

Almost done with Haruki Murakami's Killing Commendatore. I've read most of his novels and this one doesn't disappoint.


### Music

Digging Bill Evans. Recently discovered his collaboration with Tony Bennett – beautiful arrangements of some less-often-covered standards.

Obsessed with Maurice Ravel's solo piano compositions – unfathomably intricate.

There's some great songwriting in Bruce Springsteen's Western Stars.
